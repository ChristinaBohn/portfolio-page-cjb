# portfolio-page-cjb
## My first built-from-scratch web application, a personal portfolio page.

HTML and CSS styling are used in this project to create a portfolio webpage including an about section, clickable cards of completed projects, and 
contact links. This will allow me to showcase my progression in web development and provide a functional application in which to practice and apply new skills.

Media queries were included to make the webpage responsive to different screen sizes.

The first project in the work section is webpage on which I refactored the HTML and CSS for accessibility and readability.

## What I learned

Working through this project, I've learned the importance of keeping my code organized and of making small, incremental changes at a time. There are several sections in which I began using one method, and through research or by trial and error, found a better way of structuring the section. Keeping everything labeled and consolidated makes understanding the flow of the document and making changes to it much easier.

Chrome DevTools were super helpful in building this page. I became more comfortable using these tools to see what was happening with my elements and the space around them, and seeing the effects of changes to the code in real time.

I learned that there are about a thousand different ways of accomplishing one task, and making one change can drastically affect elements surrounding or attached to it. Changes that seem simple can become much more involved, depending on which other elements and properties are tied into it. This project was a great playground for exploring CSS properties and flexbox. Many rabbit holes were hopped down!
